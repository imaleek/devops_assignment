## Mechanisms to Ensure Reliability and Scalability

To ensure reliability and scalability within a Kubernetes cluster, several mechanisms are employed:

### Reliability Mechanisms:

1. **Resource Limits and Requests:**
   - Define the minimum and maximum CPU and memory resources a pod can utilize.
   - Helps prevent resource contention and ensures fair distribution of cluster resources among workloads.

2. **Probes:**
   - **Liveness Probes:** Check if an application is running.
   - **Readiness Probes:** Determine if a pod is ready to handle traffic.
   - **Startup Probes:** Ensure that an application has started successfully.
   - These probes are critical for maintaining the health and availability of applications.

3. **Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs):**
   - Maintain a minimum number of pods during voluntary disruptions, such as node maintenance.
   - Ensures application availability and reliability during such events.

### Scalability Mechanisms:

1. **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA):**
   - Automatically adjusts the number of pod replicas based on observed CPU utilization or custom metrics.
   - Enables applications to scale out to handle increased load and scale in during low demand, optimizing resource usage.

2. **Integration with Third-Party Tools (e.g., KEDA):**
   - Provides advanced scaling capabilities based on event sources beyond CPU and memory metrics.
   - Examples include scaling based on messages in a queue or custom metrics from external systems like Prometheus.
   - Enhances Kubernetesâ€™ native scaling capabilities, allowing for more dynamic and responsive scaling strategies.

These collective mechanisms ensure that applications remain reliable and scalable, adapting to varying workloads while maintaining optimal performance and resource efficiency.
