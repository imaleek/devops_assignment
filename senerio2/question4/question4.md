## Networking & DNS-Records Management and Networking Protection Rules

Utilizing **Calico** on Kubernetes can enforce network protection rules through Kubernetes network policies, which are applied at the pod level. These policies allow you to:

- Define rules governing ingress and egress traffic, ensuring only authorized communication occurs between pods, namespaces, and external resources.

### Extended Capabilities with Calico:

- **Global Network Policies:** Calico extends Kubernetes network policies by supporting global network policies, providing cluster-wide control and fine-grained rules like CIDR-based filtering.
  
- **BGP Support:** Calicoâ€™s support for BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) allows for seamless integration with external networks, providing enhanced routing capabilities and enabling direct communication between Kubernetes services and external systems.
