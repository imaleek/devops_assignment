##  Alerting Considerations

Below are key considerations when setting up alerting for applications deployed on a cluster:

- **Storage Utilization Alerts:**
  - Set up alerts for persistent volume claims (PVCs) reaching 80% of their allocated storage capacity to provide early warnings on potential storage exhaustion.
  - Configure alerts for failed attempts to provision new persistent volumes (PVs) or bind to PVCs, which can indicate misconfigurations or underlying infrastructure issues.

- **CPU and Memory Utilization:**
  - Configure alerts for pods exceeding 85% of their CPU or memory requests for a prolonged period to identify pods that may require resource adjustments or optimization.
  - Monitor and alert for pods that consistently reach their resource limits, as this may suggest under-provisioning and the need for scaling out.

- **Cluster-Wide Resource Contention:**
  - Set up alerts for nodes experiencing resource pressure, such as high CPU, memory, or disk usage, which can indicate the need for scaling the cluster or rebalancing resources.

- **Log Analysis Alerts:**
  - Configure alerts for specific critical error messages or patterns in logs, focusing on application-specific errors that require immediate attention.

- **Network Policy Violations:**
  - Set up alerts for any traffic that violates defined Calico network policies, indicating potential security breaches or misconfigurations.
  - Monitor and alert unauthorized or suspicious attempts to access external networks or services from within the cluster, as these may signal a compromised pod or malicious activity.
